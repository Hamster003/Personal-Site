Hi my name is Nathan Jacobson
I'm a student at RRC Polytech in the Cyber Security program. 
I'm really interested in Information Security and find the whole field extremely interesting. 
In my spare time I like to mess around with my server at home and try different selfhosted software out.
I'm also slowly learning Koine Greek and do a little photography.
